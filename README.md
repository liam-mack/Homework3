# Password Generator

Basic Password Generator that takes inputs from the user and stores them in localstorage before displaying

*       Password is form via concatenation of pre-stored Array variables

*       Array is selected based on user selected Criteria in the Form
*       On this note: I believed a Form was the cleaner option when compared to Alerts. In order to demonstrate knowledge they were still included.

*       Comments were added through .js file to explain operations, there may still be redundancies however.
